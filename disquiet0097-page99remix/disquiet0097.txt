Step 4a: The letters A through L will correspond with the notes along the chromatic scale from A to G#. To convert a letter higher than L, simply cycle through the scale again (i.e., L = G#, M = A, etc.). Capital letters should be played slightly louder than lowercase letters.

Step 4b: Any spaces and any dashes/hyphens will be treated as blank, as a silent moment.

Step 4c: A comma or semicolon will signify a note one step below the preceding note.

Step 4d: A period, question mark, or exclamation point will signify a note one step above the preceding note.

Step 4e: All other punctuation (colon, ampersand, etc.) will be heard as a percussive beat.
