This is my entry for the 97th Disquiet Junto project, where we were asked to take an 80-character excerpt from a book we're reading, transform it into a melodic line based on some simple rules, and make a short track out of it.

I'm currently reading Thomas Pynchon's novel "Bleeding Edge", so I used that as my source. The excerpt (including the terminal comma) was: "a gong from a hitherto-unreleased Fu Manchu movie goes off, abrupt and strident,".

I mapped the derived melody to La Monte Young's Well-Tuned Piano tuning, which is in just intonation. The piece consists of eight simultaneous renditions of the melody, played twice. The first time through, the eight lines are played at the same speed but with slight offsets in time, creating a rhythmic echo/tremolo effect. The second time, they repeat starting with the same offsets, but lines two through eight are each scaled slightly differently so that by the end, they converge on unison.

I made the piece entirely with Csound, using Steven Yi's graphical composition environment blue. The instrument I used is called "Sine modulo pluck" and was designed by Mark Van Peteghem for use within blue.
