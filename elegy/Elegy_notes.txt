"Elegy, for Jon" is a very slow menuration canon in three voices (meaning that each voice plays the 13-note subject at a different speed), with accompanying drone. The canon is stated twice, the first time all in the same register, and again with the voices at different transpositions. It is in just intonation, using the Centaur tuning, and it is tuned to 60 Hz. It was created completely in Csound.

This original version of this piece was written in 2009 for the album Complex Silence 4 (which is available on my Bandcamp site), and used a different tuning based on the golden ratio. Later that yeaer, I decided to make a new version in just intonation. As it happens, I finished this on the same day as the unexpected death of a very close friend, and thus it became an elegy in his name. The version heard here is a revision completed in October 2025.
