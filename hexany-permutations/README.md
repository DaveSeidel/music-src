These are the source files for the Hexany Permutations release (https://mysterybear.bandcamp.com/album/hexany-permutations).

To compile the sound files, change to the hexany-permutations directory and execute the shell script "build" (this is a Bash script for Linux).

Prerequisites: you must have python, sox, and csound installed and on the path.
