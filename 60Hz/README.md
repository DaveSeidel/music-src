This is the source code for my release "~60 Hz" (http://recordings.irritablehedgehog.com/album/dave-seidel-60-hz).

I used Steven Yi's blue (http://blue.kunstmusik.com/) to compose this piece. The files with the ".blue" extension are the blue project files. For the convenience of people who may not be using blue, I have also included Csound CSD files, generated by blue from the project files.
