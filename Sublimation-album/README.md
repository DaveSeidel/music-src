Sublimation-album
=================

Source code for the music on the mysterybear release Sublimation. The code is for Csound (*.csd) and blue (*.blue). There are also a few Scala files (scale definitions for Scala the microtonal music software, not Scala the programming language).

The title piece, Sublimation, has been revised a bit for higher sound quality, so it is no longer identical to the code used to make the original CD-R/netlabel/Bandcamp release. The other pieces have not been revised yet, but probably will be eventually.
